### Some comments about my writen code:
## Attributes:
make:The brand of the car
color:The car's color
model:The model of the car
price:The price of the car in dollars
year:The manufacturing year
## Methods :
display_info():Show details about the car

show_model(): Displays the most expensive car n the world 
dream(): Prints a statement about dream car purcase 
show_price(): Displays the price of the car

 ## OOP Concepts Used:
 Class: blueprint for creating car objects
 Object : An instance of the Car class  (my_car=Car('BMW','Black','M5',5000,2022)
 Attributes: Variables that store the car's details 
 Methods:Functions inside the class that define car behaviors
 Constructor (__init__): initialize a new car object with default or user _provided values 
 Encapsulation here all attribute are public but if one of them like __year will bw private it couldn't be accessed directly outside the class
